# BMI

Whilst learning how to use flask, i built this simple Body Mass Index Calculator. 
 
## Process

The application is built on the lightweight framework flask. 
I used python3 to create a venv (virtual Environment).
Installed flask in the application folder using pip.
Created base application named "app.py".
Chose what object would be needed from flask ( 'request_template' & 'request') 
HTTP methods "get" and "post" - The 'GET' method was used to request data from a specified resource and the post method was used to request additional data from the client to the server message body.

Defined variables used in the HTML within "index()"

Defined calculation for Body Mass within "calc_bmi()" 

Simple form within the HTML for input. 

Basic css used. (more to come)
